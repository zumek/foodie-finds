A seller gets a store page which they can customise (name, logo). 
The store page has the items for sale, best sellers, images/video/news feed with social interaction. 
Products may be shared between users and elsewhere. 
Messaging functionality.

Sales data - orders, fullfilment details (buyer pick up, seller local delivery, courier)
Multi-currency support.
Multi-country support.
Quantities to support either Metric or Imperial scales.
Tax support.
Products are sold to buyers in the same country.
Seller can define delivery range and options.
Buyers can find sellers based on their location, ie. within a certain radius.


User will purchse the product via the platform, seller gets notified, seller completes the order, updates status on platform, notification sent to buyer of order status, option to deliver locally to buyer, buyer to pick up, or delivery via courier. 
Ablitity schedule orders

The platform takes a commission from sales. 
Funds are released to the seller once a total threshold is met. ie. $200. 
Customer loyalty system - disocunts for spending more. Perhaps via redeamable points.
