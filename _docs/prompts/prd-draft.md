Help me write a PRD for an app which I'm wanting create. It's similart to Etsy, it will be a platform where users can buy and sell goods. Users can just be buyers, sellers, or both. 

A seller gets a store page which they can customise (name, logo, colours, basic layout by moving modules around the page). 
The store page has the items for sale, best sellers, images/video/news feed with social interaction. 
Products may be shared between users and elsewhere. 
Messaging functionality, store rating,

Seller properties -
Name
Store name
Location
followers
products - title, desc, availability, price, 
sales
rating
reviews

Sales data - orders, fullfilment details. User will purchse the product via the platform, seller gets notified, seller completes the order, updates status on platform, notification sent to buyer, option to deliver to buyer.

Suggest ways to moneterise. The platform could take a commission. Funds are released to the seller once a total threshold is met. ie. $500.
